These inefficiencies negatively affect Gamma International as the organization attempts to manage diverse team in a high-pace business environments.

Advancements in data analytics and machine learning (ML) now offer a transformative opportunity to modernize promotion processes. By leveraging historical and real-time employee data—such as performance metrics, training history, tenure, and demographic trends—organizations can predict promotion eligibility with greater accuracy and speed.
